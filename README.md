# 🐠 Fish Lens
Fish Lens is a fish identification mobile application designed to identify species such as billfish, demersal fish, sharks and assess fish quality using image processing techniques. Built with React Native, the app employs advanced algorithms and technologies including CNNs, Vision Transformers, YOLO, and similarity learning to achieve accurate identification and assessment.

## 📂 Project Structure
The repository uses a GitHub Flow branching model with the following branches:

- main: The stable branch containing production-ready code.
- development: The active development branch where new features and improvements are tested.
  
Developers should create feature branches from development and submit pull requests before merging changes back into development.

## 🚀 Features
- Image-Based Fish Identification: Classify various species using state-of-the-art image processing techniques.
- Quality Assessment: Assess fish quality based on image analysis.
- User-Friendly Interface: Built with React Native for cross-platform mobile support.
- Advanced Algorithms: Utilizes CNNs, Vision Transformers, YOLO, and similarity learning for accurate results.

<!-- ## 🛠️ Technologies Used
Frontend: React Native (Expo)
Image Processing: CNNs, Vision Transformers, YOLO
